                        Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It
                        contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface
                        components.

                        Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools.
                        Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high
                        maintenance burden.

                        Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. I like to think of it as a
                        cool way to write inline styling and achieve an awesome interface without writing a single line of your own CSS.
                        Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

                        A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to
                        build any design, directly in your markup.
