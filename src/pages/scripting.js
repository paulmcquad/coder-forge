                    Python is a general purpose, object-oriented programming
                    language. It has many uses, such as scripting, development
                    of web applications, machine learning and security. Many
                    people pick up Python as their first language because of its
                    easy to learn syntax.

                    Perl's acronym is sometimes called "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language". Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall
                    in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.

                    Perl is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, such as
                    for GUIs. It has been nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" because of its flexibility and
                    power, and also its ugliness.
