                      React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library for building
                      user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual
                      developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
                      However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires
                      the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.
